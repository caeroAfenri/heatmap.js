The error "The dynamic library gsrld.dll failed to load max payne 3" usually occurs when the game cannot find or access the gsrld.dll file, which is a part of the game's protection system. This file may be missing, corrupted, blocked by antivirus software, or incompatible with your system. Here are some possible solutions you can try:

To do this, open Steam, go to your library, right-click on Max Payne 3, select Properties, go to the Local Files tab, and click on Verify Integrity of Game Files.

To avoid this, you can either temporarily disable your antivirus software while playing the game, or add the game folder and the gsrld.dll file to its exclusion list.
3. Run the game as an administrator. This will give the game full access to the system resources and prevent any permission issues. To do this, go to the game folder, right-click on the MaxPayne3.exe file, select Properties, go to the Compatibility tab, check the box next to Run this program as an administrator, and click OK.
4. Update your graphics card drivers. Outdated or faulty drivers may cause compatibility issues with the game and result in errors. To update your drivers, you can either use the device manager on your PC, or download and install the latest drivers from the manufacturer's website.
